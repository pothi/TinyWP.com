Duckduckgo browser is my primary browser. Firefox, Safari, Chromium and Google Chrome come behind in that order. While using Gmail in other browsers (except DDG - DuckDuckGo), Google has worked just fine. However, ever since I migrated to DDG, Google started showing the following pop-up inside Gmail.
