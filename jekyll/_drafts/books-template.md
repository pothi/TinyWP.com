Unfinished books

These are the books that are read partially and may never read in full again. These books may be boring or the concept of such books are grasped or boring (for me). I might have missed some important points in those books. If you think I should read a book in full, please let me know.

- [Ketones, The Fourth Fuel: Warburg to Krebs to Veech, the 250 Year Journey to Find the Fountain of Youth](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B08G8TFQKS/)


### The books that impressed me the most in 2023

- The Body Keeps the Score: Mind, Brain and Body in the Transformation of Trauma - Bessel van der Kolk

'The body keeps the score' is basically clarified why certain people behave in certain way and how the body keeps the score of the mind. Wonderful read (so far).
