### The books that impressed me the most in 2023

- The Body Keeps the Score: Mind, Brain and Body in the Transformation of Trauma - Bessel van der Kolk
- Learn Politics by Samas

Learn Politics by Samas confirmed my believes and it made sure that I wasn't alone in my path. The other book isn't completed yet (70% completed at the end of 2022). It basically clarified why certain people behave in certain way and how the body keeps the score of the mind. Wonderful read (so far).
