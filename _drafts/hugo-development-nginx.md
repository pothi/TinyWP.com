[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is the most popular SSG (Static Site Generator) based on Go. Since, it is based on Go programming language, it is also cross-platform. Naturally, it competes with other popular SSGs based on javascript such as Gatsby.

Installing hugo is the easiest SSG to install too. Pre-built binaries are available for most operating systems, including macOS, Windows, Linux, OpenBSD and FreeBSD. It is available as [snap](https://snapcraft.io/) too. There are basically two versions of Hugo available for end-users. The stable version and the extended version that comes with built-in support for Sass / SCSS. Hugo also has built-in support for [LiveReload](https://github.com/livereload/livereload-js) that comes in handly if we want to develop the site locally or to create a quick mockup of a design idea.

By default, Hugo has a built-in webserver that can serve the current site on port 1313. We can see the site at `localhost:1313`. LiveReload looks for web socket connection on port 1313 on the server. In addition, Hugo can watch for any changes in files and can reload the webpage (in the browser) using LiveReload. The main condition to inject LiveReload is that the webpage should contain closing *body* tag. This is all good. However, if we are developing a site on a public-facing server, we do not want to open up any custom port. Usually, only port 80, 443 and 22 are open on a server.

This is a simple paragraph in markdown that doesn't need any special characters to denote a paragraph.

## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar


## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code


Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

``` js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```
