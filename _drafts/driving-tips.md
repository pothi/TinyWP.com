# Tips to drive safely with two-wheelers

This is a note-to-self post. Posting it on the internet to see if anyone benefits from it. In India, we drive left-side. So, if you are from a country where people drive right-side, this post may be confusing.

## Tip #1 - Use the rearview mirror

Use the rearview mirror whenever...

- you are going to overtake another vehicle.
- you are going to take left or right on a junction.
- you are going to take left or right on a road that changes direction.

## Tip #2 - Use the left-most space

Don't always go in the middle of the road. As a rule of thumb, no other vehicle should be able to go post you on your left side.
